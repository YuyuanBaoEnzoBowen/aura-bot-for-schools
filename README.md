# aura-bot-for-schools
A data-driven emotional wellness platform connecting students, parents, and schools.  This project was developed the Digital Startup Lab (ENT207TC)** module at XJTLU Entrepreneur College (Taicang).   Our goal is to design and prototype a **B2B2C SaaS solution that helps schools move from reactive management to emotional support for students.
